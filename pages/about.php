                  <p>I've spent the past 12 years designing and developing materials for multiple organizations and purposes, but largely related to consumer goods. 
                  I love the web and all of the opportunities it affords in in marketing, but lately I've been developing an interest in creating tools for daily use.</p>
                  <p>Interactive work gives me the opportunity to design build products that are used by thousands daily&mdash;and those products continue to evolve based
                  on any data we gather. How cool is that?</p>

                  <p>While buying my first home as a fixer upper, I learned that wood working and home renovation was something I thoroughly enjoyed. The jury is still out on whether I'm any good at it, though!</p>
                  <p>In terms of learning, there is never a reason to stop. History, science, and politics have always been a part of my life &mdash; at one time I considered becoming a teacher and a politician&mdash; but I was bitten by the designer and developer bug. 
                  In spite of the shift in focus, I still love those subjects and spend plenty of time reading.</p>
                  <p>I live in Michigan with my wife, dog, and three cats.</p>
